  <h1>The Changing Face of the Humanities in the Digital World</h1>  
  Academics are experiencing a constantly shifting progression in the modern world, 
  adopting all kinds of alternate routes and methods in order to consistently progress and keep up with the times. 
  In a world where it is dangerously easy for academic fields to fall flat or lose their relevance in the eyes of those 
  not specifically focused on those studies, this has never been more necessary than it is today. Society has progressed
   to a point where the humanities in particular are falling more and more to the wayside with every new development,
    which has prompted measures to be taken in order to secure their place in the world of academia, maintaining relevance 
    even in modern times. At the forefront of these methods is the movement of digital humanities, which has gained prominence
     in recent years as options have been revised in an effort to preserve the humanities. Kathleen Fitzpatrick, 
     in her article titled “The Humanities, Done Digitally” defines this phenomena most simply as, “a nexus of fields
      within which scholars use computing technologies to investigate the kinds of questions that are traditional 
      to the humanities” (Fitzpatrick 2011). Matthew Kirschenbaum, in his own article “What is Digital Humanities
       and What's It Doing In English Departments?” defines the movement as, “At its core, then, digital humanities
        is more akin to a common methodological outlook than an investment in any one specific set of texts or even
         technologies” (Kirschenbaum 2010). Basically, the digital humanities opens a door of new opportunities for
          research, literary criticism, analysis, archiving, and a myriad of other tasks that have previously been 
          left up to manual work to complete. Combining the content of humanities and the resources of STEM fields,
           this movement is twofold in its purpose: efficiency and an increase in objectivity when reviewing and
            analyzing literature.
